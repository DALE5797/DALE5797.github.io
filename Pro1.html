										<h3>Introduction</h3>										
									</header>
									<p>The goal of this project was program a server to host two clients using sockets. When one of the two clients meets certain requirements, the clients that met the requirement will act as a client-server and wait for the other client to connect to it. The client-server will then receive data from the other client and display the data to the terminal. This is all happening while the server-client remains connected to the main server.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Everything in the project was written in C. The project was also done in collaboration with one other person.</p>

									<h3>Specifications</h3>
									<p>The server will act as the main handler of the clients and the will keep a running total of the values sent in by the clients. The server should reset the totals any time a client disconnects or after the client-server routine. There can only be a maximum of two clients connected at any time with the server, meaning if a third client tries to connect the server should drop the connection.</p>
                                    <p>The clients should send values to the server and receive the running total from the server after each value is sent. Once the clients total is in the range of 1,025 and 49,151 the client will execute its client-server routine. This routine is also ran on the server for the client that is enacting it. In this routine the client will use its total from the server as the port number and will wait for a connection. The client-server will remain connected to the main server throughout this whole process.</p>
                                    <p>The client that did not reach the threshold will send in one more value to the main server. I will then proceed to receive its total, disconnect from the main server, connect to the client-server, send its total to the client-serve, disconnect from the client-server, and terminate the program. When the client-server receives the total from the other client it will print the total to the terminal, exit out of the client-server routine, and continue to function as a normal client to the main server.</p>

									<h3>Implementation and Working</h3>
                                    <h4>Server Side</h4>
									<p>In order to run the server a port number is needed. This is the first thing that is checked when the program begins. If the port number is not provided then the program will end and an error message will be displayed specifying what is needed. If there were no problems and the specified port is available to use then the server will set up using the bind and listen functions. The server will then wait for clients to connect. If a client connects to the server then a thread will be created in order to handle all of the request from the client. A confirmation statement would also be sent to the client to ensure that the connection was made.</p>

										<pre><code>while((connfd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&cli_addr, &clilen)))
{
	if(connfd < 0) //error check to see if the connection went through
	{
		perror("Error connection"); //for testing only
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}

	printf("Client Connection accepted\n");
	noClients++; //increment number of clients

	if(pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, client_request, (void*) &connfd) < 0) //if there is an error
	{
		perror("Error creating thread");
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
}</code></pre>
                                    
                                    <p>The *client_request function is used to handle all of the clients request on that thread. The first operation of the function is to distinguish the two clients, meaning which one is Client A and which one is Client B. Client A will be the client that first one that evokes the *client_request function. To assign the titles the thread ID of the first client will be assigned to the global variable c1 in the IF statement below. This statement will not trigger more than once as long as there are two clients connected to the server. </p>
                                    
                                    <pre><code>
if(x == 0)
{
	c1 = pthread_self();
	x++;
}</code></pre>
                                    <p>In order for the server to know which client is being read and written to, the thread ID of each client is evaluated with the value in c1 and then assigned to the local variable client in their thread.</p>
                                    
                                    <pre><code>//2nd thread will be client 2
client = (pthread_equal(c1, pthread_self())) ? 1 : 2;</code></pre>
                                    
                                    <p>In the case that a third client tries to connect to the server a message will be sent to that client and the server will disconnect them.</p>
                                    
                                    <pre><code>
// disconnect third client
if(noClients == 3)
{
	// write() client number exceeded -> disconnect to client
	bzero(buffer, sizeof(buffer));
	sprintf(buffer, "SERVER: Too Many Clients Connected. Disconnecting...\n");
	if((n = write(sock, buffer, sizeof(buffer))) < 0)
	{
		perror("Error writing to socket");
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}

	noClients--;

                                    <p>Now that the client are distinguished they can now send and receive data from the server. A while loop that is always true is used to keep this process going until the client disconnects from the server or the server terminates the thread. The server now writes to the client and waits for the client to send a value. When a value is received it is added to the local total in the thread, variable tot. The total is then printed on the server terminal and is also sent back to the client. If the value sent by the client is zero, it means the client wants to disconnect from the server. The server will then close the connection, terminate the thread, and reset the total for the client that disconnected.</p>

}
</code></pre>
                                    <p>The server then has to check if the total value is in between the range for the client-server routine or if the value exceeds the range. If the value exceeded the range then the server will send a message to the client and reset the total.</p>

                                    <pre><code>else if(tot > 49151)

                                    <p>If, for example, Client A’s total is in range then the server will set up the process for implementing the client-server routine. The variable port2 will contain the total value of Client A, which will be used as the port number for the client-server. This value will also be sent to Client B the next time it send in a value. The total for Client A will then be cleared since the whole process will restart afterwards and the value is stored somewhere else already. The variable port receives the thread ID of Client A in order for the other Client B to trigger the next sequence of events.</p>

                                    <p>Client A will be now be executing its routine client side while maintaining connection to the server. Client B will now trigger an IF statement that will prepare it for connecting to Client A. The server will now send Client B a message to signify that the processes is starting, will send the port number to Client B, send the latest total, resets the values of the variables port and port2, and finally close the connection with Client B and terminates the thread.</p>

                                <p>To begin, the client code will check that it has three arguments when running: the server host name, the port to be used, and the IP address of the other client. If it does not have these three things then the program will end and an error message will be displayed specifying what is needed. If there are no errors then the client will connect to the server. To send and receive data a while loop that is always true is used, but the loop is broken if the client ever needs to end connection with the server (more on that later). </p>
                                <p>The first function in the while loop is a read operation for a message sent from the server. This message is important due the fact that it determines if the client should break from the loop or keep going. If the first few characters are equivalent to the string “SERVER: TOO” then the loop will be broken and the client will disconnect from the server. This means that there are more than two clients already connected to the server, so the connection had to be terminated.</p>

                                <p>If the client does not need to close connection with the server, then it will receive values from the standard input to send to the server. If the value inputted is zero then the client will break from the loop and end the program. The following statements are in place so the processes does not break the server.</p>

This is done by comparing the message from the server with the string “Server Total 0”, so if, for example, Client A receives this message then the client will set up a socket connection using the updated total as the port number. Client A will then wait for Client B to connect, receive the data from Client B, close the connection, and then return to its previous functionality.</p>

									<h3>Final Remarks</h3>
                                    <p>For the most part the project was straight forward. Communication between the server and the clients are just read and write commands through a buffer, making sure there are the correct number of statements for each exchange so the program does not break. The difficulty lied in the server keeping track of the client totals separately and distinguishing between the two clients themselves. </p>
                                    <p>An improvement on the design would be for the server to receive the IP addresses of the two clients when they connect, so it could then send them to the opposite clients when the client-server process begins. This will mitigate the need for the clients to provide the IP address of the client they are supposed to connect to. Another improvement would be to reorganize the send and reactive statements between the client and the server. This could lessen the amount of statements need and could keep the program going if a client abruptly disconnects from the server.</p>
