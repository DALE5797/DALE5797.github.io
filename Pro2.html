										<h3>Introduction</h3>										
									</header>
									<p>This project consisted of designing an 8-to-1 multiplexer using 4-to-1 multiplexers and 2-to-1 multiplexers. The goal is to see how something can be made using smaller components in the case that there are limited resources.</p>
                                    <p>All code is written in VHDL using Xilinx Vivaldo.</p>

									<h3>Specifications</h3>
									<p>The 8-to-1 multiplexer can only be built using 4-to-1 and 2-to-1 multiplexers that are also design individually. The 8-to-1 multiplex design is to then be implemented on the Xilinx Nexys 4 FPGA, with switches 0-2 acting as the select lines, switches 3-10 acting as the input lines, and a single green LED acting as the output.</p>

									<h3>Implementation and Working</h3>
                                    <p>A multiplexer has 2^n inputs, one output, and n select lines. The select lines are the ones that control which one of the inputs will be mapped to the output. For a 8-to-1 multiplexer there are eight inputs, one output, and three select lines. For a 4-to-1 multiplexer there are four inputs, one output, and 2 select lines. Finally, for a 2-to-1 multiplexer there are two inputs, one output, and 1 select line.</p>
                                    <p>In order to meet the requirements of an 8-to-1 multiplexer, two 4-to-1 multiplexers were connected to a single 2-to-1 multiplexer. Half of the inputs would be mapped to the first 4-to-1 multiplexers while the other half are mapped to the second 4-to-1 multiplexer. This would act as the eight inputs for the 8-to-1 multiplexer. The outputs of the 4-to-1 multiplexers would then be mapped to the inputs of the 2-to-1 multiplexer, connecting the entire design together. Select lines S0 and S1 would be mapped to both of the 4-to-1 select lines, while select line S2 is mapped to the 2-to-1 multiplexer. </p>

                                    <p>Let us say we want the third input, c, routed to the output of the 8-to-1 multiplexer. The values given to the select lines are “011”. Both 4-to-1 multiplexers would send their third input, c and g, to the 2-to-1 multiplexer since their select lines received the value “11”. The 2-to-1 multiplexer will then choose the first 4-to-1 multiplexers input since its select line received the value ‘0’, so input c would be the output.</p>

                                    <p>This file will be the main file that connects all the smaller components together in order to build the 8-to-1 multiplexer. To start, the inputs and outputs used in the design had to first be defined. This was done in the entity, with S2, S1, S0, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h being defined as inputs and R being defined as an output. S0, S1, and S2 would serve as the 8-to-1 multiplexers select lines, with S2 receiving the most significant bit (MSB) and S0 receiving the least significant bit (LSM). Inputs a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h would serve as the inputs for the 8-to-1 multiplexer. R would be the output.</p>
