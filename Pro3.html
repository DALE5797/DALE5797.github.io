										<h3>Introduction</h3>										
									</header>
									<p>This project consisted of designing an arithmetic logical unit (ALU) on a system on chip (SoC) using eight 32-bit parallel load registers. The design would then be implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), specifically the Xilinx Nexys 4.</p>
                                    <p>The hardware component was coded in VHDL while the software component was coded in C. Everything was built using Vivaldo and its software development kit.</p>

                                <p>R0-R7 are 32-bit signals defined in the hardware. The slave registers used are also defined in the hardware. Slave register 2 is separated into 3 sections: Bits 2 downto 0 are used to know what register is being used for source two, bits 6 downto 4 are used to know what register is being used for source one, and bits 11 downto 8 are used to know what operation is to be performed. Slave register one is used to temporarily hold the values being defined software side, which are then to be loaded into a signals. Slave register zero is only used to display the results of every operation.</p>

                                    <p>Frist was declaring the signals being used for the design: R0-R7, a, and b. Signals R0 through R7 are used to hold the values coming in from slave register 1(slv_reg1), while signals a and b are operand one and operand two, respectively.Next was distinguishing each operation from one another. To achieve this a case statement was used for each of the operations.  The case statement only looked at the bits 11 downto 8 in slave register 2, since these bits define which operation is to be performed.</p>
                                    <p>Inside the first operation, loading, another case statement was used in order to distinguish between the eight registers and determine which one receives the value from slave register 1. This case statement looked at the bits 6 downto 4 in slave register 2 to know what register to load the value in. At the end of the case statement is the declaration of what is be outputted to slave register 0, and since the operation is loading in values, the register is zeroed out after each load.</p>
                                    
                                    <pre><code>---------------------LOAD OPERATION---------------------------------
WHEN "0000" =>
    CASE slv_reg2(6 DOWNTO 4) IS --selecting where to load the value to
        WHEN "000" => R0 <= slv_reg1;

                                    <p>The next operation, addition, used a similar process to loading. I order to determine which registers are to be used for the operation two case statements were used. The first case examined the bits 6 downto 4 in slave register 2 to assign operand 1 while the second case examined bits 2 downto 0 in slave register 2 to assign operand 2. The result of operand one and two where then assigned to the output, slave register 0.</p>

									<h3>Final Remarks</h3>
                                    <p>The design of the ALU is simple and allows more operations to be added on. Another great thing is that it uses few registers, and the ones in use are used to their full potential, meaning there is little resources being wasted. The down side is that there are some problems that could arise if there are a lot of operations trying to be performed one after another. This is due to the fact that everything is executed in parallel, in which the ALU would have to be reconfigured to handle a large amount of operations. </p>
